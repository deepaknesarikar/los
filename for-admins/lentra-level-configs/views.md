# Views

Actions enable you to hide or show any Screen / Button, while **View** enables you to disable to screen.&#x20;

View can be created in the same as Actions by mentioning the Name, Type and Description of the View.&#x20;

Example - If you want to show the SOURCING screen but only in view - only (_Disabled)_ mode, then you have to assign action and view of the screen.&#x20;
