# API Config

API config will store the credentials and all the API related details for your institute.&#x20;

Ex - URL, loginID, password, source system etc.&#x20;

Note: One integration may involve multiple APIs and hence multiple API configs. Example -bank statement analyzer has 5 apis hence you need to create 5 API configs for it. &#x20;

&#x20;Refer the file for all the API configs for existing available integrations

**Remember,**

**API configs also require Profiles to be in place. Please go through profiles as well.** Link to the API config and the linked [Profiles](../product-level/profiling-and-configurations.md)
