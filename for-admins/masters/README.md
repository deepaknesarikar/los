# Master Management

### **Introduction**

For Logging in to the Masters Data module (called MDM for the rest of the document) you need to go to the admin module and login with your credentials. The Master module is a seperate microservice but the Web is commonly built along with the Admin module.\


Master module will help you with below activities

* Create and maintain masters which are at stored at institution level
* Create dropdown masters which can be used by UI to link fields with dropdown values
* Add / Update / Delete records in the master or completely re-upload the master again
* Search fields in the master

### Master Types

Currently there are two types of masters which can be created in the MDM

1. [Standalone Masters](untitled-2.md)
2. [Dropdown Masters](untitled-1.md)
