# Sendback

The Sendback / Recommend will help you to move the case **manually**. The case movement can be done in two ways

1. User Assignment: You can tag the case to specific user so that case is not visible to other users
2. Role Assignment: You can tag the case to a role, so that case becomes visible to all the users for that role.&#x20;

{% hint style="info" %}
The allocation of the case has to be done using [Dashboard Config](../../for-admins/product-level/configure-dashboards/#section-2-query-builder), and wont be automatically allocated.&#x20;
{% endhint %}

## Process

Select Sendback button from the Options button

![](<../../.gitbook/assets/image (82).png>)

Select either Users or Roles as per your choice

![](<../../.gitbook/assets/image (81).png>)

{% hint style="warning" %}
If the dropdowns are not coming then you have missed adding one or both of the   below configs

* [Recommendation Config](../../for-admins/product-level/recomendation-config.md)
* [Sync Users](../../for-admins/institute-level/sync-users.md)
{% endhint %}

After Click on Save, user will be redirected to the Dashboard and then case will be allocated as per the config
