# Watchers

Watchers will automatically put all the user IDs and their phone number and Email Id in the watchers list. Watchers means '**whoever has to be notified about the case on any event**'&#x20;

## Description

Whenever any user will update or save any information in the case, his userID / mobile / email will get added in watchers list automatically.&#x20;

Alternatively, user can directly add their name as watchers by clicking on "Start Watching" button also.&#x20;

## Use of Watchers List

All the event triggers for sms / email will be sent to the users who are present in the watchers list only.&#x20;

Example - Once the case is approved, you want all the employees associated with that case to get email. So Watchers will maintain this list of employees. The list is auto generated and users can add themselves or remove themselves from the list
